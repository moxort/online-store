This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1. By Vladyslav Petlovyi

## User stories
This Angular project is a full-stack application with FE,BE and DB part. As for now, these features were implemented:

- User cas see all listings from all different users;
- User can see detail about all listings;
- User can fill form to contact the seller;
- User can create a listing;
- User can edit listing and save changes;
- User and delete listing;
- User can navigate through website using active routing
- BE counts how many times a listing was viewed and number is displayed on FE

Unfortunately, the main feature -- Firebase support, was not implemented as Firebase don't yet support the latest version of angular, Angular 16.
However, I did some work to prepare app for Firebase so as soon as Firebase will support Angular 16, I will fetch them together
